# Base Converter
This is a site where JavaScript will allow translation between different
number bases without having to reload the page or select a specific destination.
I want to make this happen because I am tired of rapidtables and other sites
reloading the entire page every time you update your input.

## To do
* Test every permutation (:sob:)
* Mess around with CSS maybe
