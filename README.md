# Base Converter
This will be a site where JavaScript will allow translation between different
number bases without having to reload the page or select a specific destination.
I want to make this happen because I am tired of rapidtables.

## To do
* bin to hex still has a 0 at the beginning of the hex
* bin to ascii still isn't splitting the string correctly
* `ascii.charCodeAt()` is not a function (in asciiToHex() in update() in
                                          onblur())
